XL Landing Pad:

1. What is [this](https://preview.redd.it/r12iq1f2bpd81.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=98b04c32feb70a74cd401eecb2fd78ae37d59b28)? It's a no longer functional landing pad that has three large item slots and can pass through power.

2. Where can I find it? It used to only be found on desolo, but now is found on every planet.

3. Can I land on it from space? Yes, although SES is constantly changing this functionality. Hopefully it will stay as a viable launch location.

4. Isn't this from the old tutorial? Yes, yes it is.
